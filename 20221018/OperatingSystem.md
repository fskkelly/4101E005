## Operating System(OS)
- [user mode vs kernel mode](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-user-mode-and-kernel-mode/)
  -   User-mode programs are less privileged than user-mode applications and are not allowed to access the system resources directly. 
  -   The kernel is the core program on which all the other operating system components rely, it is used to access the hardware components and schedule which processes should run on a computer system and when, and it also manages the application software and hardware interaction.

- [kernel vs shell](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-shell-and-kernel/)
  - A shell is an environment or a special user program which provide an interface to user to use operating system services. It executes programs based on the input provided by the user.
  - Kernel is the heart and core of an Operating System that manages operations of computer and hardware. It acts as a bridge between the user and the resources of the system by accessing various computer resources like the CPU, I/O devices and other resources.
